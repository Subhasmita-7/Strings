Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.


class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if len(strs) == 1:
            return strs[0]
        
        longest = strs[0]

        for i in range(1,len(strs)):
            current = strs[i]

            while not current.startswith(longest):
                if not longest:
                    return ""
                longest = longest[:-1]
        return longest
